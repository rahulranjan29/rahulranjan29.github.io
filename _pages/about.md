BIO
=====
I am a senior undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology(BHU) Varanasi, India. My broad areas of interests encompass deep learning, machine learning, computer vision, medical image analysis, image processing. I am particulary interested in solving fundamental research problems in deep learning for computer vision. For example, Self-Supervised Learning(a subset of Unsupervised Learning) is a new paradigm in deep learning which aims to learn visual features from data where supervision comes from the data itself i.e no human labeling is required. Another particular area of research I want to explore is the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing.

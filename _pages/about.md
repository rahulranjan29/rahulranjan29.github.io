Bio
======
I am a senior undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology(BHU) Varanasi, India. My broad areas of interests encompass deep learning, machine learning, computer vision, medical image analysis, image processing. I am particulary interested in solving fundamental research problems in deep learning for computer vision. For example, Self-Supervised Learning(a subset of Unsupervised Learning) is a new paradigm in deep learning which aims to learn visual features from data where supervision comes from the data itself i.e no human labeling is required. Another particular area of research I want to explore is the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. 

Background 
======
It was out of fun and exploration that I took up Machine Learning course on Coursera.org taught by Andrew Ng during the end of my freshman year and my journey couldn't have been better since then. I have worked several projects in computer vision and machine learning involving significant research which helped me develop a strong research aptitude. I was a visiting research fellow at Australian Institute Of Machine Learning, University Of Adelaide where I worked on deep self-supervised learning and domain transfer learning algorithms. At present, I am working on methods involving the use of unlabeled data to improve the performance of supervised classifiers in a semi-supervised setting.  I have enjoyed working on the application of machine learning in healthcare and am optimistic that it will be a constructive addition in healthcare specially in India.

A fun project I did out of my interest is action recognition on cricket videos using deep learning. I scrapped a lot of test match cricket videos from internet and created an action recognition dataset of batsman activities. I used Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks to classify batsman activites. A particular feature I want to add to it is the use of NLP to generate commentary. I am yet to open source the dataset[Will do it soon]. 

Other Interests
======
I have played cricket at my university for a couple of years with utmost dedication and enjoyed every bit of it. It made me learn a lot of things about life and I would always cherish that experience. I also have a profound interest in trekking and hiking. I have been to three himalayan treks up till now and enjoy challenging myself in the most natural habitats.
